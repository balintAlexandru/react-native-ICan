  <h1>Todo full stack application</h1>

<p>I've developed a practical ToDo app using React Native with an Express backend, powered by MongoDB. The main goals are to elevate my technical skills and streamline daily task management. React Native in the frontend ensures a user-friendly interface, while the Express backend, coupled with MongoDB, guarantees seamless functionality. Notable features include efficient task handling. This project goes beyond coding; it's a practical solution to simplify daily life, one task at a time.</p>
